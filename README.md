☕ javaPractice

Welcome to javaPractice — a collection of all the Java code I write while learning and improving my programming skills!

This repository is my learning playground, where I experiment with Java concepts, try new things, and track my progress as a developer.


🎯 What’s Inside?

You’ll find different kinds of Java programs, such as:

✅ Basic syntax and beginner exercises

✅ Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.)

✅ Data structures & algorithms

✅ Mini projects and challenges

✅ Anything new I learn and want to practice!
